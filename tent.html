                  <h2> Tent </h2>
                  <p>The most straightforward item you’ll need is a tent, of course. Clearly, shelter is key, as you won’t want to be too exposed to the elements — or the bugs. The type of tent you’ll want is the key, though, as it largely depends on the duration of your camping trip, the style of your excursion, and how much walking you plan on doing to get to your camping site.</p>

                      <h2> Chairs </h2>
                      <p>Now it’s time to furnish the rest of your campsite, starting with the campfire setup. When it comes to lounging around the fire, or the campsite in general, simple foldable chairs are paramount. Sure, you can lay out on the ground, or string up a hammock, but chairs are far more practical, and they make a huge difference in terms of comfort during the day when it’s time to read, eat, or just relax.</p>

                          <h2> Sleeping bag </h2>
                          <p>Another crucial necessity is a sleeping bag. Again, the type and size of sleeping bag you’ll want will vary greatly, largely contingent on where you’re camping and what the forecast is like. You’ll want to consider the time of year you’re camping and what the temperature is like, especially at night.</p>
